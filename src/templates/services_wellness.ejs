  <h5 class="mb-3">Advanced Wellness</h5>

  <p>My wellness training has been achieved over 20+ years. I am a Certified Natural Health Professional, certified through  The National Association of Certified Natural Health Professionals in March of 2014.</p>

  <p>Additionally, I have a Certificate of Completion in a Naturopathic Wellness Coaching Course, through Dr. Sheryl Duchess, N.D. from Florida in September of 2015.</p>

  <p>I have been using and educating myself about FDA-approved LED photo-rejuvenation skin therapy and IonizeMe Ionic Detoxification for over a decade.</p>

  <p>I am by no means a medical doctor, nor do I prescribe in any way. Perhaps the best way to describe me is as a &ldquo;whole-body wellness person&rdquo;. Over my many years in business, I have studied extensively in the natural health and wellness of the body.</p>

  <p>As of March 2019, I will be persusing a home herbalist certificate as part of my constant pursuit of continuing education.</p>
